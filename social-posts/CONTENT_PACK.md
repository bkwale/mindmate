## Post 1 — Launch (post-01.png)
**Post first**

**Instagram caption:**
A space to reflect.

MindM8 is live. A free emotional wellbeing tool that helps you think more clearly about what you're feeling and what you need to say.

No sign-up. No data stored in the cloud. Just you and your thoughts.

## Post 2 — What it is (post-02.png)
**2-3 days after Post 1**

**Instagram caption:**
Not therapy. Not a chatbot. Not a journaling app.

MindM8 is a structured space where you can arrive carrying something — an unnamed feeling, a difficult conversation, a sense of being overwhelmed — and leave having seen it more clearly.

It asks questions. The insight comes from you.

mindm8.app — free to use, no sign-up required.

## Post 3 — The gap (post-03.png)
**Key post for NHS/healthcare audience**

**Instagram caption:**
There's a space between feeling distressed and getting help.

In that gap, people escalate. GPs get repeat visits. Conversations are unfocused. Anxiety builds.

MindM8 sits in that space. Not as treatment. As preparation. Helping people arrive clearer before they reach services.

## Post 4 — Privacy (post-04.png)

**Instagram caption:**
Your thoughts stay yours.

MindM8 has no accounts, no cloud storage, and no way for anyone — including us — to access your reflections. Everything stays on your device.

Privacy isn't a feature. It's the architecture.

## Post 5 — Voice input (post-05.png)

**Instagram caption:**
Some people think better when they talk.

We heard you. MindM8 now supports voice input — tap the mic and speak instead of type. Available across every part of the app.

Because clarity shouldn't depend on how fast you can type.

## Post 6 — Arrive clearer (post-06.png)
**Strongest quote — save for mid-campaign**

**Instagram caption:**
This is the idea behind everything we're building.

Not a diagnosis. Not a fix. Not a set of coping strategies. Just a space that helps you see what you're carrying a little more clearly — before you walk into the room, before you pick up the phone, before you sit down with someone.

Arrive clearer. That's it.

I'm not trying to help people feel better. I'm trying to help them arrive clearer.

That's the whole idea behind MindM8.

## Post 7 — Check-in (post-07.png)

**Instagram caption:**
How are you arriving today?

One word. That's all it takes to start. MindM8's daily check-in tracks how you're feeling over time and connects it to your past reflections — so patterns become visible, gently.

## Post 8 — Four modes (post-08.png)

**Instagram caption:**
Four ways to arrive.

Arrive Clearer — process an emotion or something you can't name yet.
Arrive Ready — prepare for a difficult conversation.
Arrive Present — ground yourself in a moment of overwhelm.
Just Be Here — two minutes of guided breathing. No AI. No questions.

Each one meets you where you are.

## Post 10 — Built in Hereford (post-10.png)
**Good final post before the March 25th meeting**

**Instagram caption:**
Built in Hereford. For anyone, anywhere.

MindM8 started as a simple idea — what if people could arrive clearer at their own thoughts before they reached services, conversations, or decisions?

That idea is now a live app being used by people across the UK and beyond. We're just getting started.
